# A-longitudinal-study-of-bike-infrastructure-impact-on-bike-share-system-performance

Cities of all sizes now have bike share systems. In Small- to medium-sized cities with sparse public transit, bikesharing complements transit and provides better access to and from existing lines. In large and dense cities that have a robust network of transit lines and services, bikesharing may offer quicker, cheaper, and more direct connection for short distances normally traveled by walking or public transit. The sustainability of bike share systems depends on the bicycle network connectivity and accessibility. City planning agencies need to forecast and analyze bike share demand in order to make investment decisions of bike facilities. In order to measure the marginal cost of building bike lanes on bike share demand at a network-wide level over time, an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) with autoregressive (AR) disturbance model is proposed to capture system-wide bike ridership. The model is applied to investigate the relationship between the Citi Bike average daily trip counts and the total length of bike lane in NYC. Our result shows that around 100 more Citi Bike daily trips will be conducted with one additional models of bike lane installed. New bike lanes have a positive impact on weekend cyclistsâ€™ activities, and no significant impact on weekday. We demonstrate that this model, as oppose to previous study in the literature developed at the station level, can provide new insights to system-level causality and temporal lag characteristics. It will help city planning agencies make decisions in terms of allocating funding to support bike lane infrastructure.
